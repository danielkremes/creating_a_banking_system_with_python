## Description
This project is about building a simple banking system using Python, implementing basic operations such as deposits, withdrawals, and account status management.

## Features and To-Do

### 1. Deposit
- **No need for user information:** Account number, agency, and user name are not required for the deposit operation.
- **Deposit operation:**
  - The deposit value should be stored in a variable.
  - The deposit stratum (account balance) should also be stored in a variable.
  - The deposit should be positive, not negative.
  - The deposit should be limited to a maximum of R$ 500.00 per operation.

### 2. Withdraw
- **No need for user information:** Account number, agency, and user name are not required for the withdrawal operation.
- **Withdrawal operation:**
  - The withdrawal value should be stored in a variable.
  - The withdrawal stratum (account balance) should also be stored in a variable.
  - There is a withdrawal limit of 3 withdrawals per day, with a maximum of R$ 500.00 per withdrawal.
  - If the user tries to withdraw more than the available balance, the system should show an "Insufficient funds" message.
  - The withdrawal value should be positive, not negative.
  
## Additional Notes
- The system is intended to be simple, focusing on core functionality with basic security and validation.
- Further features and improvements may be added in later versions, including account management, interest rates, and more.
